BUGS TO FIX:

1. Intel_Extreme_Masters_2025/Dallas/Europe/Open gives incorrect stage for R64 matches
    - Probably due to how Rounds are labeled in the page's src - have a group of RxMx headers at the top
    describing the bracket then for 5-6th place a new R1 header which conflicts with the old R1 headers
    - I imagine for smaller tournaments, will have more variety with how the src is shaped so more potential for error

2. regex =  r'<!--\s*(.*?)\s*-->\s*(.*?)(?=\s*<!--\s*\w+|$)' in parse_playoff_data
    - For future events, this regex can sometimes false positive onto other labels(e.g. <-- August 23, 2025 -->)
    - Obvious solution is to hardcode the terms "final", "stage", "match", etc but that is a really stupid way imo 
    - Need to find a better solution to find proper titles
    

NEW FEATURES:

1. Probably will have to use html parsing to get all players, tournaments, etc.
2. For multi-stage tournaments(e.g. majors) - parsing the other stages when calling the original tournament - maybe using pipe operator to get multiple stages in one request
3. Other Games
